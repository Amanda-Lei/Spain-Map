# Spain-Map

SPAIN MAP
This project was started at the request of a Spanish teacher at my high school. She wanted an interactive map that she could direct students to and use for homework to learn about the various regions of Spain.

1. We would create a program with a graphical interface that displays a map of Spain that is color-coded by region. 
2. Users could click on each region, and a pop-up window would appear with pictures and text (posted in both English and Spanish) that display information about the region's culture, history, geography, food, cities, and economy.
3. Additionally, these pop-ups would also allow the user to listen to audio files providing region-specific information as well as information about local accents. This audio would be spoken in Spanish and would allow for students to practice their oral comprehension skills.
4. After listening to and reading about the information in a region, a quiz would appear within the pop-up window which would test the user's comprehension of the text and audio information.
5. Users would be free to explore each region of Spain through these pop-up windows they can click on, and test both their oral comprehension skills, as well as their understanding of the information they read/listen to.
