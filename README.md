# Spain-Map

SPAIN MAP
This project was started at the request of a Spanish teacher at my high school. She wanted an interactive map that she could direct students to and use for homework. It would be a map of Spain where you could click on and learn about the various regions of Spain. Clicking on a region will result in a pop-up window containing information (filled in and updated by the teacher) and a button to the correlating quiz which would then count towards homework. Progress is tracked and a notifier should appear once all regions have been successfully studied.
